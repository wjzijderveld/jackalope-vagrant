# Jackalope Vagrant

This repository provides a Vagrant setup that install Jackalope with both Jackrabbit as Doctrine-DBAL backend.

This way it should make developing and testing Jackalope features a bit easier.

## TODO

Jackrabbit doesn't start without provisioning the box yet. Need to add an init.d script for it.
